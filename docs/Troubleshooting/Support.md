# Support

As of the latest release, the SSS has been solely developed by students inside of the [BYU NET Lab](https://netlab.byu.edu) and participants in the BYU ECEN IMMERSE 2022 program. While we might not have the exact same group to maintain the demos they made over the summer, the current group of students in the lab frequently monitor the [issues](https://www.github.com/NET-BYU/sss/issues) and [pull requests](https://www.github.com/NET-BYU/sss/pulls) on the repository.

Please feel free to open either and [issue](https://www.github.com/NET-BYU/sss/issues) or [pull request](https://www.github.com/NET-BYU/sss/pulls) at any time!
