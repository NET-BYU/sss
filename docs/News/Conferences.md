## PyCon US 2023

The SSS was presented at the PyCon US 2023 conference along with a poster with the aim to show off a hardware system that can be used to teach Python to students and control different hardware interfaces. Many people were excited to see the sign and were delighted that they came all the way to Salt Lake City to get rickrolled in a low resolution.
